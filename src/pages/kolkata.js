<p>The region that passed on from the hands of the Nawabs of Bengal to those of the earliest British representatives of the East India Company is often tagged as the Cultural Capital of India. This heritage city of India is also known to be the birthplace of urban Indian culture & literary thought and a majority of India’s notable literary figures stemmed from here. This place should definitely be on your bucket list if you want to experience the roots of modern Indian sub-culture.</p>
 <p>What’s Special: Victoria Memorial, Howrah Bridge, Indian Museum, and St. Paul’s Cathedral are the most prominent tourist places in Kolkata.
