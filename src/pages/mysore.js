<p>Mysore has been often called the Cultural capital of Karnataka and there are reasons galore. Spectacularly built palaces and amazing museums make it one of the major heritage places in India. The myriad art galleries here showcase traditional paintings influenced by Vijayanagar kingdom (Mysore paintings) and Mughal empire (Ganjifa art). Mysore silk sarees, Udupi cuisine, and dasara festivities are other highlights of the city’s rich cultural heritage.</p>
   <p>What’s Special: Amba Vilas Palace (Mysore Palace), Lalitha Mahal, and Chamundi Hilltop Temple are most popular tourist places in Mysore.</p>
    <p>For A Walk Through The City’s Culture: Tourists can visit St Philomena’s Church, Mahabaleshwar Temple, Jaganmohan Palace (with in-house art gallery), Rajendra Vilas, and Jayalakshmi Vilas Mansion to see the city’s rich cultural heritage. Indira Gandhi Rashtriya Manav Sangrahalaya (Museum of Anthropology), Folklore Museum, and Regional Museum of Natural History are some of museums in Mysore that must be visited.</p>
