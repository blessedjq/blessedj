      <img src={qutu} alt="Qutub Minar" width="50%" height="100%"/>
<p>Built in 1192 to depict the beginning of Islamic rule in India – Qutub Minar stands 73m high, is a tower of victory as the building’s construction was commenced by Qutub-ud-din-Aibak right after he declared his victory over the last Hindu kingdom in Delhi.</p>
<p>
The Qutub tower is made up of distinct storeys, and each has a projecting balcony. The diameter of the storeys decreases gradually when measured from top to bottom – 15 m diameter at the base to just 2.5 m at the top. Red sandstone heightens the beauty of the three stores, while the fourth and fifth storeys are beautified with marble and sandstone. The ground floor of the tower is a Quwwat-ul-Islam Mosque, which is considered as the first mosque to be constructed in India.

An interesting fact to know – The inscribed letters over the eastern gate explain that the Qutub Minar was constructed with the material incurred after destroying ’27 Hindu temples’.

Qutub Minar in Delhi is one of the renowned heritage tourist places of India. It is visited by several tourists every year.
