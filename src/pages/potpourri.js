<p>Delhi – the cosmopolitan & capital city of India – has been strongly influenced by several religions and dynasties. Rajputs, Sultans, Khiljis, Mughals, and even British ruled on these lands and left behind a part of their selves in the form of monuments, paintings, artifacts, literary works, customs, festivals, and more. It is, perhaps, the major reason that most of the famous festivals of India are celebrated here with equal enthusiasm and celebrities.</p>
<p>What’s Special: India Gate, Red Fort, Old Fort, and Qutab Minar are the most prominent tourist places in Delhi.</p>
<p>For A Walk Through The City’s Culture: Take a sightseeing tour of the historical places in Delhi if you wish to experience the city’s rich cultural heritage. But that’s not it. Museums, art galleries, cultural centers, theatres, and various food joints together make Delhi one of the best places of Indian cultural heritage.</p>
